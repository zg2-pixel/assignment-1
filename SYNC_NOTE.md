### Repository Synchronization Note

During the class exercise, we were required to demonstrate **fork, modify, and merge** operations among classmates.  
To complete the task, I manually **detached my fork** from the original course repository.  
As a result, the automatic "Sync fork" function was disabled, and later I had to manually fetch and merge updates.

After restoring the repository, three parallel commit histories now exist:

1. **`main`** – Synced with the latest version from the instructor’s repository.  
   (This branch reflects the current official version for Assignment 1.)
2. **`old-main`** – My original submission history before detaching the fork.  
   (Contains my previous commits and local changes.)
3. **`restore-pr1`** – Recovered history from my classmate’s earlier pull request (`add newstyle`).

I intentionally preserved these branches so that both my own previous work and collaborative contributions from classmates remain visible for review.  
Please note that the multiple branches and divergent commit graphs result from the detachment and manual synchronization process.
